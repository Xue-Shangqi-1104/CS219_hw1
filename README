The program will be able to take input from a file and perform different operations based on 
what the given instruction was. The program will take the hex number and perform the arithmetic 
operations. The output should all be correct and it will also be displaying if there is an overflow.

To run this program, you will have to type: 
1. g++ -c driver.cpp
2. g++ -o calc driver.o 
3. ./calc 
It will display all the information necessary

The working process:
First, the program will use the fstream library to read the file and store the values with the help of a for loop.
Second, the values stored will be converted into uint32_t data type using sstream.
Third, the arithmetic operation will be performed before figuring out if there is an overflow.
    (the overflow is detected by seeing if operand one is greater than 0 and then subtracting the maximum unsigned 32 bits possible by the second operand, if the second operand is greater than zero, there will be an overflow)
Fourth, the program uses printf to format and print out the necessary information.
